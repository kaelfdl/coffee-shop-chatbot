Welcome to Harvest Roast, your cozy neighborhood coffee shop, where every sip is a step towards a greener world. Nestled in the heart of Makati, Philippines, we’ve created a haven for coffee lovers who care as much about the planet as they do about a perfect brew.

Our Story
Harvest Roast was founded with a simple yet powerful mission: to bring people together over coffee while nurturing our planet. Inspired by the changing seasons and the earth’s abundant offerings, we set out to create a coffee experience that is as sustainable as it is delicious.

Our Coffee
From bean to cup, sustainability guides everything we do. We source our beans from ethical, environmentally-conscious farms that prioritize fair trade and eco-friendly practices. Our in-house roasting process is energy-efficient, highlighting the distinct flavors of every origin we showcase. Each cup of Harvest Roast coffee reflects the care and respect we have for the farmers and the earth.

Community & Sustainability
We believe sustainability starts with community. At Harvest Roast, we use biodegradable packaging, encourage reusable cups, and partner with local businesses to reduce our carbon footprint. Our café features eco-friendly materials, and we host workshops on composting, sustainable living, and coffee brewing techniques. Every decision we make, big or small, is a step toward creating a more sustainable future.

Delivery & Menu
Can’t make it to the café? No problem! Our eco-conscious delivery service ensures your favorite brews and freshly-baked goods reach you in sustainable packaging, minimizing waste. Our menu caters to everyone with plant-based milk options, vegan treats, and gluten-free delights—all sourced from local producers who share our values.
